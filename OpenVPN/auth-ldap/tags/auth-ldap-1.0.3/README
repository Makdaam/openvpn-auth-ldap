INTRODUCTION

The openvpn-auth-ldap plugin implements username/password authentication via
LDAP.

You may send patches, bug reports, and complaints to:
	landonf@opendarwin.org

REQUIREMENTS

* OpenLDAP Headers & Library
* GNU Objective-C Compiler
* OpenVPN Plugin Header (included with the OpenVPN sources)

BUILD

To build, you will need to configure the sources appropriately. Example:
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-openldap=/usr/local --with-openvpn=/usr/ports/security/openvpn/work/openvpn-2.0.2

The module will be build in src/openvpn-auth-ldap.so and installed as
${prefix}/lib/openvpn-auth-ldap.so.

USAGE

Add the following to your OpenVPN configuration file (adjusting
the plugin path as required):

	plugin /usr/local/lib/openvpn-auth-ldap.so "<config> <dn template> ..."

The config directive must point to an auth-ldap configuration file.
An example is provided with the distribution.

More than one DN template may be provided - the module will attempt to bind
to each in order. %u specifies username substitution. Example:
	uid=%u,ou=People,dc=example,dc=org


CAVEATS

This plugin only works with the OpenLDAP libraries. It may not compile out
of the box on your system. It may not work for you at all.
