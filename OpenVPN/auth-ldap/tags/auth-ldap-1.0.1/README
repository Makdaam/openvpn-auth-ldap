INTRODUCTION

The openvpn-auth-ldap plugin implements username/password authentication via
LDAP.

This module was developed for internal company use, and as such,
has not been tested anywhere other than FreeBSD.

Your mileage may very. I'll happily accept patches.

You may send patches, bug reports, and complaints to:
	landonf@opendarwin.org

REQUIREMENTS

* OpenLDAP Headers & Library
* GNU Objective-C Compiler
* OpenVPN Plugin Header

BUILD

To build, you will need to edit the Makefile for your platform.

The module will be named openvpn-auth-ldap.so

USAGE

Add the following to your OpenVPN configuration file:

	plugin openvpn-auth-ldap.so "<config> <dn template> ..."

The config directive must point to an auth-ldap configuration file.
An example is provided with the distribution.

More than one DN template may be provided - the module will attempt to bind
to each in order. %u specifies username substitution. Example:
	uid=%u,ou=People,dc=example,dc=org


CAVEATS

This plugin only works with the OpenLDAP libraries. It may not compile out
of the box on your system. It may not work for you at all.
